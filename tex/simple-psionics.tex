\section{Simply Psionics}

This is psionics system designed to be very easy to play, without any accounting of psi points or complex powers.
It is meant to be a pluggable option, rather than a class.
The inspiration comes from multiple sources:
Eleven from Stranger Things, who has a few simple but powerful abilities,
and the Stephen King novel \emph{Carrie}, and others.
In essence - I do not want to track points, I do not want to create psi-swords or anything of the swoerd.
I just want to play a PC or create an NPC with telepathy, telekinesis, or pyrokinesis in the traditional sense.\par

How psionics fits within the world is up to the DM.
If this is a rare and not-well-known phenomemnon,
the origin feats described below can be overpowered.\par

\subsection{Telekinesis}

Telekinesis is a collection of four feats, and players can take as many as they want.
